# Apple Magic Key Keyboard layout for Windows 10
Remapping of the Apple Magic Keyboard to work with Windows 10

I have a Apple Magic Keyboard that I want to use with my Windows 10 computer while maintaining the same keyboard layout I'm using on my Macbook. This is the closest I can get. Thought I would share... :) 

:exclamation:
**Unfortunately the Fn button on the Apple Magic Keyboard is not recognized by Windows 10**, so smart controls such as `volume up` and `volume down`, as well as `Home` and `End` keys is not working (as they rely on the Fn-key to work). If you have a fix for this, please let me know or make a pull request! :pray:  

## How to get started

1) Download the Keyboard Layout Creator from Microsoft https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134

2) Watch @FilipeCruz's video will help you on your way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE1Z29oJ_Ko&ab_channel=FilipeCruz

3) Download the keyboard layout file from this repo, load it and install it

4) Reboot

5) Change the keyboard layout in your `Language preferences` in Windows 10

6) Enjoy :smile:
